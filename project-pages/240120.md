In this project Alessandro Bellini implements a chess engine in C. Chess is an interesting problem from a computer science and machine learning persepctive. The game is zero-sum and full information, but the action space is huge! In this implementation we use bitwise operations and other tricks to make move generation extremely fast. On this backbone old school algorithms like alpha-beta pruning shrink the search space and find good moves!
